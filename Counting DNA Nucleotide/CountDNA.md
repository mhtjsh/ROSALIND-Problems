# Counting DNA 

The `CountDNAnt` function is designed to count occurrences of a specified pattern (substring) in a given DNA sequence. Below is the structured explanation and implementation in both standard Python and Biopython.

## Purpose

To identify the number of times a specific pattern appears in a DNA sequence, useful for tasks like motif detection, sequence analysis, and pattern matching in biological datasets

## Key Concept 
- **Input:**
  - `Genome`: The DNA Sequence to search within
  - `Pattern`: The Pattern or K-mer to count
- **Output:**
  - The count of `pattern` occurences in the `Genome`
