# üêç [ROSALIND](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) Problems ‚Üî Solutions Curated
I am curating a solution repository to Rosalind Questions. I think Rosalind question are the Leetcode website which curates the best question to generally solve and attack the understanding part of the algorithms with the mix of Biology

Rosalind is an educational platform dedicated to teaching bioinformatics through problem-solving and programming. Similar to Leetcode, Rosalind offers a curated set of algorithmic challenges that blend computer science with biological concepts, helping users deepen their understanding of both fields.

This repository serves as the starting point for a growing library of solutions to Rosalind problems, organized by topic and difficulty level. Each solution is written in clear, well-commented code and includes explanations of the problem statement and the approach used to solve it. The goal is to create a comprehensive, collaborative resource for anyone tackling Rosalind's challenges.

Rosalind was founded by [Phillip Compeau](https://compeau.cbd.cmu.edu/) and [Pavel Pevzner](https://bioalgorithms.ucsd.edu/), distinguished scientists in bioinformatics and computational biology.

## üåüCall to Collaborate 
I am initiating this repository as a collaborative project and invite you to contribute by adding and improving solutions. Let's work together to make this a valuable resource for bioinformatics enthusiasts worldwide! Feel free to push solutions, suggest improvements, and share insights to help build this repository into a thriving community resource.
